#Chrono Engine Workflow

The ProjectChrono ecosystem includes tools, plugins and libraries, most
of them revolving around the Chrono::Engine middleware.

The Chrono::Engine middleware is a modular set of libraries for physical
simulations, organized in [units](Units "wikilink"). Some of those units
allow interfacing Chrono::Engine to external software, for example for
pre-processing and post-processing data, or for displaying real-time
simulations with OpenGL, or for parsing Python commands.

This means that there are many options for the assets workflow. In a
broad context, the following picture shows some of these possibilities:
